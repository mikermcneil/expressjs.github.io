### Contributing to this document

+ The additional metadata in the table below which was not available on github was curated manually in [`./standalone/render-expressjs-modules/modules.meta.json`]().
+ The script in [standalone/get-expressjs-repos]() fetches an up-to-date list of all these various repos.  Some of them are relevant, some are not.
+ The curated metadata is merged with the up-to-date remote list to generate the table below.
+ Dynamic data from the remote list always takes precedence over what's in the curated metadata.
+ The datasets are merged using each repo's "name" property as a key.

See [`./standalone/render-expressjs-modules/modules.meta.json`]() to edit the hand-curated metadata.

Also see md comments in this file for expected output of the table above (in case something goes wrong).
